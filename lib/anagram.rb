# 5 Rules to consider

# 1. Check if two words are anagrams if they are they return "These words are anagrams"
# 2. Account for possibility of cases (still are anagrams)
# 3. To check if the inputs are words ex: pkm is not a word
# 4. If they are anagrams it should check to see if it is antigram
# 5. Account for two sentences being compared as anagrams or antigrams (spaces/punctuation do not count(remove))

# make two arrays comparing strings

class Anagrams
  
  def anagram_antigram(word1,word2)
    array
